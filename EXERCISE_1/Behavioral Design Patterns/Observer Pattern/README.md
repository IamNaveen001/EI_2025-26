# Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of any state changes, typically by calling one of their methods. This pattern is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems.

## Example: Weather Station

In this example, the WeatherData class (subject) maintains a list of Observer objects. When the weather data changes, it notifies all registered observers. The CurrentConditionsDisplay class implements the Observer interface and displays the current weather conditions when notified.
